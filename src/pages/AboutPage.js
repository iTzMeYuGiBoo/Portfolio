                I’m a software developer with a strong background in front-end engineering and a growing focus on data analytics. 
                I started my career building scalable web applications and later pursued a master’s degree in Data Analytics.
                During my studies, I also worked as a chef at Skylon Hotel in Dublin — a role that strengthened my time management and multitasking skills. 
                Whether I’m writing React code or working with data models, I aim to build solutions that are smooth, efficient, and user-friendly.
              </p>

              <h2>My Journey</h2>
              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                My journey into tech began with a BSc in Computer Science & Engineering from SASTRA University, 
                where I built a strong foundation in programming and software design. After graduation, 
                I joined Incedo Technologies Solutions Limited (client: Verizon) as a software engineer, where I worked on high-impact front-end projects, 
                performance optimization, and scalable system architecture in a global telecom environment.
              </p>

              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                Eager to deepen my understanding of data and analytics, I pursed MSc in Data Analytics at the National College of
                Ireland, I&apos;m focused on the intersection of front-end
                engineering and data science. My thesis on &quot;Impact of
                Macroeconomic Factors on Newly Built Residential Property Prices
                in Dublin&quot; achieved 88 % model accuracy using ensemble
                machine-learning techniques.
              </p>

              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                While studying, I also followed a personal interest and worked part-time as a chef at Skylon Hotel, Dublin. 
                This hands-on experience helped me develop strong time management, multitasking, 
                and pressure-handling skills — qualities that complement my work as a developer.
              </p>

              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                Today, I bring together my experience in software engineering, data analytics,
                 and the discipline of hospitality to deliver solutions that are efficient, reliable, and user-focused.
              </p>

              <h2>My Approach</h2>
              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                I believe the best digital products are those that disappear –
                interfaces so intuitive and responsive that users never have to
                think about them. This philosophy guides my development process,
                where I combine:
              </p>

              <ul className="approach-list">
                <li>Meticulous attention to UI details and accessibility</li>
                <li>Performance-first engineering with comprehensive testing</li>
                <li>Data-driven decision making backed by analytics</li>
                <li>
                  Collaborative problem-solving with cross-functional teams
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
              <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me experimenting with new
                recipes (old habits die hard!), exploring Dublin&apos;s hidden
                corners, or diving into data-visualization projects that make
                complex information accessible.
