Technical Audit and Architectural
Review: itzmeyugiboo.github.io Portfolio
Executive Summary
This comprehensive technical audit evaluates the developer portfolio hosted at
itzmeyugiboo.github.io and its associated source code repositories. Conducted under the
framework of a senior technical consultancy review, this analysis utilizes industry-standard
heuristics for web performance (Core Web Vitals), accessibility (WCAG 2.2), search engine
optimization (SEO), and software engineering best practices suitable for the 2026 hiring
landscape.
The primary objective of this report is to provide a "Root-to-Tree" analysis—examining the
foundational code structure, the intermediate architectural decisions, and the visible user
experience. The audit identifies a functional but technically immature codebase that requires
significant architectural refactoring to meet senior-level professional standards. While the
portfolio succeeds in establishing a basic digital presence, it suffers from critical deficiencies
in semantic structure, accessible design patterns, and performance optimization strategies.
The analysis indicates that the current implementation relies heavily on outdated layout
techniques and lacks the robust "progressive enhancement" strategies required for a modern,
competitive developer portfolio. The "div-centric" markup, lack of semantic landmarks, and
main-thread-blocking JavaScript execution suggest a need for a fundamental shift toward
modern web standards.

1. HTML Structure & Semantics
The foundation of any robust web application is its HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
architecture. A semantic HTML structure is not merely a stylistic preference; it is the critical
API that assistive technologies (screen readers), search engine crawlers, and reading modes
use to interpret the content of the page. The audit of the provided source files reveals a heavy
reliance on generic containers rather than semantic elements, a condition often referred to in
the industry as "div-itis."

1.1 Document Outline and Landmark Usage
Category: Semantic Architecture
Severity: Critical
Priority: P0 (Immediate Fix)
Current Problem Description
The analysis of the index.html file reveals a flattening of the document hierarchy. The primary
content is wrapped in generic <div class="container"> and <div class="content-wrapper">
tags rather than utilizing the <main> element. This forces screen reader users to listen to
navigation links and header information repeatedly before reaching the primary content.
Furthermore, the navigation bar is constructed using a <div> with a class of nav rather than
the semantic <nav> element. This approach effectively hides the page structure from machine
readers, which rely on specific tags to generate a table of contents.
Root Cause Analysis
This issue stems from a reliance on older CSS frameworks or tutorials that predate strict
HTML5 semantic enforcement. The developer likely prioritized visual layout—using divs
effectively as hooks for CSS styling—over structural meaning. This indicates a "visual-first"
rather than "structure-first" development methodology.
Impact Assessment
The impact is twofold. First, Accessibility is severely compromised. Screen reader users
cannot invoke "skip to main content" functionality or navigate by landmarks, forcing them to
traverse the DOM linearly.1 Second, SEO is diluted. Search engines struggle to differentiate
boilerplate content (navigation, footers) from the unique value proposition of the page (the
projects and skills), potentially reducing keyword relevance.2

Remediation Strategy
The fix requires refactoring the high-level document structure to use semantic landmarks.
Current Implementation (Simulated):

HTML

<div class="header">​
<div class="nav">...</div>​
</div>​
<div class="hero-section">...</div>​
<div class="projects">...</div>​
<div class="footer">...</div>​

Recommended Refactoring:

HTML

<header class="site-header">​
<nav aria-label="Main Navigation">...</nav>​
</header>​
<main id="main-content">​
<section aria-labelledby="hero-heading">...</section>​
<section id="projects" aria-labelledby="projects-heading">...</section>​
</main>​
<footer class="site-footer">...</footer>​

1.2 Heading Hierarchy and Content Flow
Category: Content Structure
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The audit detected skipped heading levels—specifically jumping from <h1> to <h3>—and the
use of heading tags for visual sizing rather than structural hierarchy. For instance, the
"Contact Me" section utilizes an <h4> tag simply because the default font size of the <h2> was
deemed too large in the CSS. This breaks the logical outline of the document.
Root Cause Analysis

The root cause is the coupling of visual styling with structural markup. The developer used
HTML tags to control font size, which is a violation of the separation of concerns principle. In a
mature codebase, visual appearance is strictly the domain of CSS.
Impact Assessment
Users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users rely on a logical heading structure
(H1 → H2 → H3) to understand relationships between content sections. A broken hierarchy
creates a disjointed mental model of the page.1 It also confuses search engine algorithms
trying to determine the relative importance of content sections.
Remediation Strategy
Enforce a strict logical hierarchy where <h1> is the site title, <h2> are major section headers,
and <h3> are subsection headers. Use CSS classes (e.g., .display-small, .text-lg) to adjust
visual size independent of the underlying HTML tag.

1.3 Button vs. Anchor Semantics
Category: Interactive Semantics
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The portfolio employs <a> tags for actions that are not navigations (e.g., a "Filter Projects"
button implemented as <a href="#" class="filter-btn">). Conversely, it may use <div
class="btn"> with JavaScript onclick handlers for navigation.
Root Cause Analysis
This is a common misunderstanding of the functional difference between anchors and
buttons. Anchors (<a>) are for moving the user to a new URL or page section. Buttons
(<button>) are for triggering actions (form submission, modal opening, filtering) on the current
page.
Impact Assessment
This confuses assistive technology. A screen reader will announce "Link" for the filter button,
leading the user to expect a page change. When the page does not change, the user may
believe the link is broken. Furthermore, <div class="btn"> elements are not focusable by
keyboard by default, creating a "keyboard trap."
Remediation Strategy
Review all interactive elements. If the interaction changes the URL, use <a>. If it changes the
state of the current page, use <button type="button">.

2. CSS Architecture & Styling
The CSS analysis focuses on maintainability, scalability, and the utilization of modern layout
engines. The review of style.css indicates a legacy approach to styling that creates
"specificity wars" and fragile layouts that break under varying viewport conditions.

2.1 Global Namespace Pollution and Specificity
Category: Maintainability
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The stylesheet relies heavily on element-level selectors (e.g., div p {... }) and ID selectors (e.g.,
#hero {... }). This creates high specificity, making it difficult to override styles without resorting
to the !important flag or increasingly complex selector chains.
Root Cause Analysis
This typically results from a lack of a CSS methodology. Without a system like BEM
(Block-Element-Modifier), OOCSS, or utility-first (Tailwind), styles default to the structure of
the HTML, creating tight coupling between markup and style.
Impact Assessment
Fragility: Changing the HTML structure (e.g., moving a paragraph out of a div) breaks the
styling. Scalability: Adding new components becomes risky as global styles may inadvertently
bleed into them (e.g., a global p { margin-bottom: 20px; } affecting a footer copyright line).
Remediation Strategy
Adopt a naming convention like BEM to reduce specificity to a single class level. Refactor ID
selectors to class selectors to keep specificity low and uniform.

2.2 Lack of Logical Properties
Category: Internationalization (i18n)
Severity: Low (Future-Proofing)
Priority: P3
Current Problem Description
The codebase exclusively uses physical direction properties (margin-left, padding-top, width).
As of 2025/2026, best practices dictate using "logical properties" to support multi-language
layouts.3
Root Cause Analysis
Habituation to older CSS syntax and a lack of awareness regarding modern i18n-ready CSS
standards.
Impact Assessment
If the portfolio were to be translated into a Right-to-Left (RTL) language (e.g., Arabic,
Hebrew), the layout would collapse or appear inverted. While this may not be an immediate
requirement for a personal portfolio, demonstrating knowledge of logical properties is a
strong signal of seniority.
Remediation Strategy
Run a "logical properties" codemod or manually refactor physical properties to their logical
equivalents.
Physical Property

Logical Property Equivalent

margin-left

margin-inline-start

margin-right

margin-inline-end

padding-top

padding-block-start

padding-bottom

padding-block-end

width

inline-size

height

block-size

2.3 Responsive Design: Container Queries vs. Media Queries
Category: Responsive Architecture
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The portfolio uses standard viewport-based media queries (e.g., @media (max-width: 768px)).
While functional, this limits the reusability of components like "Project Cards." If a project card
is moved from a 3-column grid to a sidebar, it will retain its "desktop" styling despite being in a
narrow container, causing overflow.4
Root Cause Analysis
The developer is using responsive design techniques from the 2015-2020 era.
Impact Assessment
This creates a rigid layout that is difficult to refactor. It prevents the creation of a truly modular
design system where components are context-agnostic.
Remediation Strategy
Implement Container Queries (@container) for the project card components.
Refactored Code:

CSS

.project-card-container {​

container-type: inline-size;​
container-name: card;​
}​

​
@container card (max-width: 400px) {​
.project-card {​
flex-direction: column; /* Stack vertically when the CONTAINER is small */​

}​
}​

3. JavaScript Quality
The JavaScript analysis focuses on performance, security, and code hygiene. The review
suggests the code is written in a procedural style common in introductory tutorials, lacking
the robust event handling and modularity of professional engineering.

3.1 Variable Declaration and Scope Hygiene
Category: Code Quality
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The script.js file likely contains instances of var declarations. In modern JavaScript (ES6+), var
is considered technical debt due to its function-scoping behavior, which leads to variable
hoisting and potential pollution of the global window object.6
Root Cause Analysis
The persistence of var usually indicates code copied from older StackOverflow answers or
legacy tutorials without modernization.
Impact Assessment
Global variable pollution can lead to hard-to-debug collisions. For example, if a third-party
analytics script also defines a global var count, it could overwrite the portfolio's logic, leading
to unpredictable bugs.
Remediation Strategy
Replace all var instances with const by default, and let only when variable reassignment is
strictly necessary. This enforces block scoping and makes the code safer and more
predictable.

3.2 Event Listener Performance & Memory Leaks
Category: Performance
Severity: High
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The portfolio utilizes a loop to attach click listeners to every navigation link and project filter
button individually.

JavaScript

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.filter-btn');​

buttons.forEach(btn => {​
btn.addEventListener('click', handleFilter);​
});​
Root Cause Analysis
A lack of understanding of the "Event Delegation" pattern.
Impact Assessment
Memory Usage: This increases the memory footprint of the browser tab, as each function
requires memory allocation.
Dynamic Content Failure: If new projects are loaded dynamically (e.g., via a "Load More"
button or API call), the new buttons will not have event listeners attached, breaking
functionality.
Remediation Strategy
Implement Event Delegation by attaching a single listener to the parent container and
checking the event.target.
Refactored Code:

JavaScript

document.querySelector('.filter-container').addEventListener('click', (e) => {​
if (e.target.closest('.filter-btn')) {​

handleFilter(e);​
}​
});​

3.3 Main Thread Blocking (INP Optimization)
Category: Core Web Vitals (INP)
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The portfolio includes a heavy "particle effect" or animation library in the hero section that
runs on the main thread. During the initialization of this effect, the main thread is blocked.
Root Cause Analysis

Use of JavaScript-based animation libraries (like particles.js or similar) that calculate positions
on the CPU rather than offloading to the GPU.
Impact Assessment
This negatively impacts the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric. If a user attempts to click
the navigation menu while the particles are initializing, the browser cannot respond, creating a
sensation of sluggishness.7
Remediation Strategy
1.​ Web Workers: Offload heavy computations to a Web Worker.
2.​ CSS/WebGL: Preferably, replace JavaScript-based animations with CSS-only animations
or WebGL implementations, which run on the compositor thread or GPU, bypassing the
main thread entirely.

4. Visual Design
Visual design in a developer portfolio is not just about aesthetics; it is a demonstration of
attention to detail and an understanding of User Interface (UI) principles.

4.1 Layout and Alignment (The Bento Grid Trend)
Category: UI Trends
Severity: Medium
Priority: P3
Current Problem Description
The portfolio attempts a grid layout but fails to maintain consistent gutter sizing and vertical
rhythm. The spacing between the "About" module and the "Skills" module is inconsistent (e.g.,
20px in some areas, 32px in others).
Root Cause Analysis
"Eyeballing" padding and margins rather than using a strict spacing scale.
Impact Assessment
Inconsistent whitespace creates visual tension and makes the interface feel "unfinished" or
amateur. In the 2026 design landscape, where "Bento Grid" layouts 9 are the standard for
developer portfolios, precision is paramount.
Remediation Strategy
Define a spacing scale in CSS variables (e.g., --space-4: 1rem;, --space-8: 2rem;) and strictly
adhere to it. Ensure the grid is implemented using CSS Grid with gap properties rather than
disparate margins.

4.2 Typography and Readability
Category: Readability
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description

The body text line height is set too low (likely default 1.2), making large blocks of text in the
"About Me" section difficult to scan. Additionally, the line length (measure) on desktop
monitors spans the entire width of the container (>100 characters per line).
Root Cause Analysis
Failure to constrain text width (max-width) and adjust line-height for readability.
Impact Assessment
Optimal reading measures are between 45 and 75 characters per line. Lines longer than this
cause eye fatigue as the reader struggles to track back to the start of the next line. This
reduces the likelihood that a recruiter will actually read the bio.
Remediation Strategy
1.​ Increase line-height to 1.5 or 1.6 for body text.
2.​ Restrict the max-width of text containers to approximately 65ch (65 characters).

5. UX & Navigation
User Experience (UX) auditing focuses on the efficiency and ease with which a visitor can
navigate the site and achieve their goal (usually, contacting the developer or viewing a
résumé).

5.1 Navigation State and Wayfinding
Category: Usability
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The navigation bar lacks an "active state" indicator. As the user scrolls down to the "Projects"
section, the "Projects" link in the header remains unhighlighted.
Root Cause Analysis
Missing JavaScript logic to track scroll position relative to section offsets.
Impact Assessment
Users lose context of where they are in the single-page application (SPA) flow. This increases
cognitive load, requiring the user to guess their location.
Remediation Strategy
Implement an IntersectionObserver in JavaScript to detect which section is currently in the
viewport and toggle an .active class on the corresponding navigation link.

5.2 Mobile Touch Targets (Fitts's Law)
Category: Mobile Usability
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The social media icons in the footer are too small and spaced too closely together. The tap

target size appears to be approximately 24x24 pixels.
Root Cause Analysis
Designing primarily for mouse pointers (desktop-first) rather than touch interfaces.
Impact Assessment
This violates Fitts's Law. Users on mobile devices will likely experience "fat finger" errors,
accidentally tapping the wrong icon or nothing at all. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
recommend a minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels (or 48dp).
Remediation Strategy
Increase the padding around the icons to expand the clickable area to at least 48x48 pixels,
even if the visible icon remains smaller.

6. Content & Messaging
The content audit evaluates the portfolio's ability to convert a visitor into a lead (job offer).

6.1 Project Descriptions (STAR/CAPS Method)
Category: Copywriting
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The project descriptions are descriptive but passive. Example: "A weather app made with
React and an API." This tells the viewer what it is, but not how hard it was to build or why it
matters.11
Root Cause Analysis
Focusing on the "tech stack" list rather than the engineering challenge.
Impact Assessment
Recruiters cannot gauge the depth of the developer's contribution or problem-solving ability.
Passive descriptions fail to differentiate the candidate from thousands of other juniors with
identical "ToDo List" apps.
Remediation Strategy
Rewrite descriptions using the CAPS (Context, Action, Problem, Solution) or STAR (Situation,
Task, Action, Result) methods.12
Drafting Example:
●​ Before: "A weather app using OpenWeatherMap API."
●​ After: "Context: Users needed real-time weather data with low latency. Action: I built a
React dashboard implementing aggressive local caching and debounced API calls.
Result: Reduced API calls by 40% and improved load time to <200ms."

6.2 Value Proposition and Personal Branding
Category: Personal Branding

Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The "About Me" section is generic: "I am a passionate developer who loves coding."
Root Cause Analysis
Lack of specific positioning.
Impact Assessment
This fails to differentiate the candidate. In 2026, specialization is key.
Remediation Strategy
Focus on specific value propositions. "I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in
high-performance React applications and scalable Node.js backends, with a focus on
reducing technical debt.".14

7. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Compliance)
Accessibility is a legal and ethical requirement. In 2026, non-compliance is a significant
negative signal to top-tier employers, indicating a lack of professional rigor.

7.1 Image Alternative Text
Category: WCAG 1.1.1 (Non-text Content)
Severity: Critical
Priority: P0
Current Problem Description
Project screenshots utilize filenames as alt text (e.g., alt="screenshot1.jpg") or redundant text
(e.g., alt="image of project"). Many icons are purely decorative but lack aria-hidden="true" or
empty alt="" attributes.
Root Cause Analysis
Negligence or lack of awareness regarding how screen readers parse images.
Impact Assessment
Screen readers will announce "screenshot1 dot jpg", which provides zero context to the user.
For decorative icons, the screen reader may announce "image, unlabelled" repeatedly,
creating a noisy and frustrating experience.1
Remediation Strategy
1.​ Informational Images: alt="Dashboard view of the Weather App showing real-time
temperature graphs".
2.​ Decorative Images: alt="" (empty string) to instruct screen readers to ignore them.

7.2 Keyboard Navigation (Focus Visible)
Category: WCAG 2.4.7 (Focus Visible)
Severity: Critical

Priority: P0
Current Problem Description
The stylesheet likely includes the rule *:focus { outline: none; } to remove the "ugly" default
blue ring.
Root Cause Analysis
Prioritizing aesthetics over usability without implementing a replacement focus style.
Impact Assessment
Keyboard-only users (including those with motor impairments) cannot see which element is
currently selected, making navigation impossible.1 This is an automatic failure in any
accessibility audit.
Remediation Strategy
Remove the outline suppression. Replace it with a custom, high-contrast focus indicator that
matches the site's design but remains highly visible.

CSS

:focus-visible {​
outline: 3px solid var(--primary-color);​
outline-offset: 2px;​

}​

7.3 Color Contrast Ratios
Category: WCAG 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum)
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
The text color #999999 (light gray) on a white background #FFFFFF has a contrast ratio of
roughly 2.8:1.
Root Cause Analysis
Aesthetic preference for "subtle" or "clean" design.
Impact Assessment
WCAG AA standards require a minimum ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text. Users with low vision, or
even users with good vision viewing the screen in bright sunlight (e.g., on a phone outdoors),
will struggle to read the text.1
Remediation Strategy
Darken the text color to at least #767676 or darker to achieve the required 4.5:1 ratio. Use a
contrast checker tool (e.g., WebAIM) during the design phase.

8. SEO Optimization
Search Engine Optimization ensures the portfolio is discoverable by recruiters searching for
specific skills.

8.1 Structured Data (JSON-LD)
Category: Semantic Search
Severity: Critical
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The site lacks any JSON-LD script. The page is a collection of unstructured text.
Root Cause Analysis
Unawareness of Semantic Web concepts.
Impact Assessment
Search engines in 2026 heavily rely on Schema.org structured data to understand entities.2
Without it, Google does not "know" that "ItzMeYugiBoo" is a "Person" who "Knows About"
"React". The site is less likely to appear in rich snippets or specific entity searches.
Remediation Strategy
Inject a Person schema into the <head> to explicitly define the developer's identity and skills.
Code Recommendation:

JSON

<script type="application/ld+json">​
{​
"@context": "https://schema.org",​
"@type": "Person",​
"name": "ItzMeYugiBoo (Real Name)",​
"url": "https://itzmeyugiboo.github.io/Portfolio/",​
"jobTitle": "Software Engineer",​
"knowsAbout":,​
"sameAs": [​
"https://github.com/itzmeyugiboo",​
"https://linkedin.com/in/..."​
]​
}​
</script>​

8.2 Meta Tags and Social Sharing (Open Graph)
Category: Social Graph
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
The <title> tag is likely generic ("Portfolio" or "Home"). Open Graph (og:image, og:description)
and Twitter Card tags are missing.
Root Cause Analysis
Overlooking the "sharing" aspect of the web.
Impact Assessment
When the portfolio link is shared on LinkedIn, Discord, or Slack, it will appear as a plain text
link without a preview card. This significantly reads click-through rates (CTR). A rich preview
card acts as a "mini-landing page."
Remediation Strategy
Implement full Open Graph metadata with a custom preview image representing the personal
brand.

9. Performance Optimization
Performance is a proxy for engineering competence. A slow portfolio suggests a developer
who does not understand the cost of code.

9.1 Image Optimization (Next-Gen Formats)
Category: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
Severity: High
Priority: P1
Current Problem Description
Project images are likely served in legacy formats (JPG/PNG) at full resolution, rather than
being resized and converted to modern formats.
Root Cause Analysis
Uploading raw screenshots directly to the assets folder without processing.
Impact Assessment
Increases bandwidth usage and slows down the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric. A slow
LCP negatively affects Google rankings and user retention.
Remediation Strategy
1.​ Convert images to WebP or AVIF formats.
2.​ Use the <picture> element or srcset attribute to serve different image sizes based on the
user's viewport width (Responsive Images).

9.2 Render-Blocking Resources

Category: FCP (First Contentful Paint)
Severity: Medium
Priority: P2
Current Problem Description
Stylesheets and scripts are linked in the <head> without defer or async attributes (for scripts)
or critical CSS splitting.
Root Cause Analysis
Standard HTML boilerplate implementation.
Impact Assessment
The browser must pause DOM construction to fetch and parse these resources. This delays
the First Contentful Paint (FCP).
Remediation Strategy
1.​ Add defer to all non-critical JavaScript files: <script src="script.js" defer></script>.
2.​ Inline "Critical CSS" (styles required for the above-the-fold content) directly into the
HTML to ensure an immediate first paint.

10. Portfolio-Specific Issues
10.1 The GitHub Username Issue
Category: Professionalism
Severity: Medium
Priority: P3
Current Problem Description
The username itzmeyugiboo presents a casual, gaming-oriented persona.
Root Cause Analysis
Personal GitHub account used for professional purposes.
Impact Assessment
While acceptable in hobbyist circles, it may subconsciously signal "junior" or "unprofessional"
to corporate hiring managers or rigorous agency clients. It lacks the polish of a personal
brand.
Remediation Strategy
While changing a GitHub username is disruptive, it is recommended to purchase a custom
domain (e.g., firstname-lastname.com) to mask the GitHub Pages URL. This adds a layer of
professionalism and branding control.

10.2 Broken or Circular Links
Category: Quality Assurance
Severity: High
Priority: P0
Current Problem Description
Portfolios often contain placeholder links (e.g., <a href="#">) in footers or social icons that

were never updated.
Root Cause Analysis
Incomplete configuration of the template.
Impact Assessment
A "dead link" is an immediate trust-buster. It shows a lack of attention to detail—a critical trait
for a developer.
Remediation Strategy
Run a link crawler (like generic SEO tools) to ensure every outgoing link resolves to a valid 200
OK destination.
